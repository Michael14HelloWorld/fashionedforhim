Hi! 
Welcome to Fashioned for Him! I'm Miriam and a stay at home 
mommy delighting in the warmth of faith and family! I love that
my Heavenly Daddy is a King! Being a sweetheart wife to my handsome 
Prince and also a mommy are delightful to me! I spend my days 
relishing our precious family, creating cozy spaces in our home, and 
whipping up delicious and nutritious meals and fun snacks! My 
sweetheart and I love sharing hope and teaming up with other moms 
and dads in growing successful businesses from home! Every day is a 
gift. I treasure the minutes and remind myself they are as pearls 
to be protected and lived out with purpose. Thanks for visiting and
hope you'll keep popping in! To read my latest blog post, click here!
